    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">Find answers to the most common questions about our services and products.</p>
    
    <div class="faq-grid">
      
      <!-- Question 1: Where is my money stored? -->
      <div class="faq-card">
        <div class="faq-icon">💰</div>
        <h2>Where is my money stored?</h2>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Your capital is <strong>never transferred to us</strong>. It remains securely in your own MT5 (MetaTrader 5) trading account with your chosen broker.</p>
          
          <p>Here's how it works:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Account:</strong> You maintain full ownership and control of your trading account at all times.</li>
            <li><strong>Our Products:</strong> Our MT5 Expert Advisors (EAs) are software tools that execute trades automatically based on our strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Connection:</strong> You connect our products to your MT5 account, allowing them to place trades on your behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You can disconnect our products at any time, and you always have access to withdraw your funds directly from your broker.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="highlight">We never have access to withdraw or transfer your money. Your funds stay with your regulated broker.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 2: Can you take my money? -->
      <div class="faq-card">
        <div class="faq-icon">🔒</div>
        <h2>Can you take my money?</h2>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p><strong>No, we cannot access your funds.</strong></p>
          
          <p>Our business model is based on providing trading software (Expert Advisors) that you install on your own MT5 platform. We do not have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access to your broker account credentials</li>
            <li>Ability to withdraw funds from your account</li>
            <li>Control over your capital</li>
            <li>Permission to transfer money</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>You decide to use our MT5 products through your bank or broker. The relationship is between you and your financial institution. We simply provide the trading tools and strategies.</p>
          
          <p class="highlight">Your security is paramount. We operate transparently, and your money always remains under your control with your regulated broker.</p>

        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Tax obligations and regulatory compliance vary by country and individual circumstances. We recommend:</p>
